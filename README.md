# Ex3_OS


## about the project
  we were asked to take an exicting code of a server that use forks for multiply clients and turn into
  thread server instead of forks.
  
  we used ptheard.h
  
  
 ## how to run
   ### first methoed:
        use the exe files Server,client, Theard_S
        use ./ to run this files in terminal
        
        fork: ./Server other terminal window ./client
        theard: ./Theard_S other terminal window ./client

        
   ### seconed methoed:    
        compile by yourself:
            type make for creating all the exe files
           
            type make clean for deleteing all exe files and object files
            that maybe crated.
             
            for using forks server type:
            ./Server
             than open another terimnal window and type
             ./client


            for using theards server type:
            ./Theard_S
             than open another terimnal window and type
             ./client
